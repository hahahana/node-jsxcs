# Deprecated/Obsolete

JSCS now (since v1.8.0) supports changing the esprima (ast parser) to esprima-fb (Facebooks version of esprima that can parse JSX). This makes JSXCS as a standalone tool obsolete. Same functionality (and more) can be achieved with jscs by using the following command. 

    npm install jscs esprima-fb
    jscs --esprima=esprima-fb

# JSXCS

Wrapper around [jscs](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs) to allow running jscs for JSX files.

## How to install
    npm install jsxcs -g

## How to use
See [jscs](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs) for guides.

## Caveats
As jsxcs works by ignoring errors on lines that are generated by the JSX transformer, some errors with actual user made styling issues might get omitted.
